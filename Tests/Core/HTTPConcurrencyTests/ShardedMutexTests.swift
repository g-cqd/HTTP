//  ``ShardedMutex`` and ``SharedBoundedLRU``: the lock partition preserves mutual exclusion, and — the
//  point of the whole exercise — the capacity bound is *global* and hard, not per shard. Sharding a
//  bounded table is where a cap quietly turns into `shards × cap`, so the bound is asserted under
//  concurrent inserts and across capacities that do not divide evenly (audit finding 9, CWE-400).
