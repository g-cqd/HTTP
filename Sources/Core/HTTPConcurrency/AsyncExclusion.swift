//  HTTPConcurrency
//
//  Mutual exclusion for a critical section that must stay closed **across an `await`** — the case no
//  other tool in this package covers:
//
//  - `Mutex` (Synchronization) is a thread-blocking lock. Holding one across a suspension point is
//    not expressible, and holding one across a *socket wait* would park a cooperative thread on a
//    peer that may never act — the failure mode audit FLAKE-1 removed from the accept path.
//  - An `actor` does not serialize either: actor methods are **reentrant**, so a second caller enters
//    the moment the first `await`s. Actor isolation protects stored state between suspension points;
//    it says nothing about a multi-step operation that spans them.
//
//  So a holder here suspends the *Task* and releases the cooperative thread, exactly as ``AsyncGate``
//  does in the test tier — but with mutex semantics (acquire/release, FIFO hand-off) rather than a
//  permit gate. Continuations resume outside the lock, and a cancelled waiter unregisters without
//  consuming the hand-off.
//
//  CWE-833 (deadlock) is the standing hazard: this exclusion is NOT reentrant, and a body that
//  re-enters it on the same task waits forever. Callers keep the ungated core of a critical section in
//  a separate method and take the exclusion once, at the outermost entry point.
//
