//
//  The concurrent face of ``BoundedLRU``: a ``ShardedMutex`` over one `BoundedLRU` per shard, with a
//  single mutating entry point. That single entry point is the whole design. The bug this type exists
//  to make unrepresentable is the two-critical-section shape
//
//      if map.count >= cap { prune(&map) }      // section 1: decide there is room
//      map[key] = value                          // section 2: insert unconditionally
//
//  which is unbounded whenever the prune finds nothing to drop, and racy besides. ``withShard(for:_:)``
//  hands the caller the shard's map for one compound read-modify-write under one lock acquisition, so
//  the check and the insert structurally cannot come apart (CWE-400 / CWE-367).
//
//  The global bound is hard: `capacity` is divided across the shards by *floor*, and the shard count
//  is clamped so that division is at least one. Sharding therefore never raises the total above the
//  requested capacity — it can only lower it slightly, which is the safe direction. The cost is skew:
//  keys are spread by a per-process-seeded hash, so one shard can fill while another is empty and
//  evict (or refuse) a little earlier than a single global map would have.
//
