//  BoundedLRU.swift
//  HTTPConcurrency
//
//  A capacity- and cost-bounded map with least-recently-used recency — the shared primitive behind
//  every table in this package that claims to be bounded (the rate-limit client budget, the session
//  store, the response cache). It exists because each hand-rolled version of that pattern repeated one
//  of two bugs. Either the cap was enforced by a *conditional* prune that only dropped idle entries,
//  so a flood of live ones grew the map without bound (CWE-400 resource exhaustion, reached through
//  the CWE-770 "allocate on an attacker-chosen key" door); or recency was a list of `class` nodes
//  holding strong `prev` *and* `next` references — a cycle ARC can never collect, so every evicted
//  entry stayed resident for the life of the process (CWE-401).
//
//  Recency here is an index-linked list threaded through a contiguous slab of slots: `Int32` offsets,
//  not object references, so there is nothing to cycle and the whole structure is one
//  `ContiguousArray` plus one `Dictionary`. Slots are appended lazily and reused from a free list, so
//  `capacity: 1_000_000` costs nothing until it is populated, and a freed slot clears its key and
//  value so both are released immediately rather than pinned by the slab.
//
