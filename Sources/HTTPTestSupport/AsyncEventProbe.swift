//  A suspend-until-count event boundary for deterministic async tests: production code calls
//  `record(_:)` from any isolation; a test `await`s `wait(forAtLeast:)` until enough events land, then
//  inspects `events`. Beyond native `Confirmation` (which only counts within a closure, and can
//  neither suspend-until-a-count, expose the recorded events, nor diagnose a stall).
