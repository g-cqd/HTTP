//
//  DeadlineWheel.swift
//  HTTPServer
//
//  ONE timer facility for the whole server, replacing three (`IdleDeadline` + `runIdleWatchdog`, the
//  per-operation `runLocalIdleWatchdog`, and `HTTP3StreamDeadlines`' own watchdog).
//
//  The defect it exists to fix: all three stored their target behind a `Mutex` and left a watchdog
//  parked in `clock.sleep(until:)`. Arming an EARLIER deadline therefore did not wake the sleeper, so
//  a fast 60 s body read followed by a 15 s keep-alive budget was enforced ~45 s late — the Slowloris
//  bound the operator configured (RFC 9112 §9.3; RFC 9114 §4.1 for HTTP/3; CWE-400) silently did not
//  hold. ``arm(_:until:)`` here wakes a parked watchdog whenever the wheel's minimum moves earlier.
//
//  Structure: an *indexed* binary min-heap keyed by the clock's instant. Each slot remembers where it
//  sits in the heap, so re-arming is an in-place key update plus a sift — O(log n), and allocation-free
//  once the heap and slot storage have reached their steady-state capacity, which matters because a
//  re-arm happens around EVERY read. The alternative (push a fresh entry, discard stale ones on pop)
//  would grow the heap with the number of re-arms rather than the number of live timers.
//
//  Not a hashed timing wheel: bucketing needs a fixed tick, and a bucket array sized for the spread
//  between a 1 s write budget and a 3600 s header budget is either coarse enough to lose the short end
//  or large enough to cost more than the heap it replaces. A heap needs no tick at all.
//
//  Keyed by a concrete `Duration` measured from the server's epoch rather than by the injected clock's
//  `Instant`. `Instant` is an associated type, so a wheel generic over it is *address-only* in the
//  unspecialized generic code the server actually compiles to (`HTTPServer<C: Clock>` is instantiated
//  in the client module, so nothing specializes across the boundary): `Array.swapAt` on address-only
//  elements and every `Optional<Instant>` temporary then heap-allocate. Measured at 24 allocations per
//  re-arm — around every read, at 200k rps. Concrete `Duration` keys make it zero. ``HTTPServer``
//  converts at the two edges it owns (see `deadlineKey(after:)`).
//
//  Standards: RFC 9112 §9.3, RFC 9114 §4.1/§8.1; CWE-400 (uncontrolled resource consumption),
//  CWE-416 in shape (the generation token on ``DeadlineHandle``).
